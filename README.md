This is a simple TCP/IP-based chat application developed in C++ using POSIX sockets and multithreading. The application enables real-time communication between multiple clients via a centralized server. Each client can send messages that are broadcast to all connected users, and the server can also participate by sending admin messages from its terminal. Designed to demonstrate key networking and concurrency concepts, this project uses standard C++ libraries like std::thread, std::mutex, and system-level socket programming. It serves as a hands-on learning example for implementing concurrent I/O handling, message broadcasting, and basic client-server architecture in C++.
